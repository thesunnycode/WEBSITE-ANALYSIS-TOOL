reate a minimal GET handler for /api/website-analysis/history that returns mock data (which you can later connect to your backend/database).
now can you please check the sidebar issue the side bar is visible on the dashboard but when i click on any icon the sidebar disappears 
Here’s what’s happening and how to fix the sidebar disappearing issue:
Diagnosis
On the dashboard (/dashboard), the sidebar is visible because it’s rendered by the DashboardLayout in frontend/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx, which always includes <Sidebar />.
On other routes (like /analysis/new), the sidebar disappears. This is because those routes do not use the same layout as the dashboard—they use their own layout (or none at all).
Example:
frontend/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx includes the sidebar.
frontend/app/dashboard/layout.tsx and frontend/app/analysis/layout.tsx do not include the sidebar.
How to Fix
To have a persistent sidebar across all main app pages:
Use a shared layout (e.g., app/layout.tsx or a top-level layout) that always includes <Sidebar /> for all relevant routes.
Or, ensure that every section (dashboard, analysis, history, etc.) uses a layout that includes the sidebar.
Recommended Solution
Move the sidebar to a top-level layout (e.g., app/layout.tsx or a shared layout for all authenticated pages).
Or, refactor your route structure so that all main pages (dashboard, analysis, history, etc.) are children of a parent layout that includes the sidebar.
Next Steps
Would you like me to:
Refactor your layouts so the sidebar is always present on all main pages (dashboard, analysis, history, etc.)?
Or, do you want the sidebar only on the dashboard?
If you want it always visible:
I’ll update your main layout to include the sidebar for all authenticated pages, ensuring a consistent experience.
Let me know your preference, and I’ll implement the fix!
